AI Usage Notes:

AI was used to clarify GitHub steps such as creating folders, adding files, and tagging releases.

Received guidance on writing example commands and repository structure.

Drafted sample README and documentation text with AI assistance, later edited by me.

No code or notebook solutions were generated by AI; all analysis was my own work.

I reviewed and verified all suggestions before including them in the repository.

Full responsibility for the final content and accuracy rests with me.
